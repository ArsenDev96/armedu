/**
 * Registry of the artwork shipped in `public/images/`, keyed by content slug.
 *
 * Slugs are shared across every edition (they are Latin by design), so one
 * registry serves all three locales — only the alt text and caption, which come
 * from the locale's `UiDictionary`, differ per edition.
 *
 * Kept here rather than in the content files for two reasons: the same slug is
 * rendered as an article, a writer card and a search hit, and repeating the path
 * in three locale bundles is three chances to typo it. `validate:content`
 * asserts that every entry below exists on disk and matches a real slug.
 *
 * Two filenames deliberately differ from their slug — `first-republic-armenia`
 * and `mesrop-mashtots` — which is exactly why this is an explicit map and not a
 * `/images/${category}/${slug}.webp` convention.
 *
 * The cuisine artwork arrived with one file misspelled (`lavalsh.webp`). It was
 * renamed rather than mapped: the other five match their slug exactly, so the
 * two exceptions above stay the only ones, and a typo recorded here would read
 * as a deliberate difference the next time someone edits this file.
 *
 * The extensions are not a convention either. Everything here is WebP except the
 * places artwork, which is PNG — another reason the paths are written out in
 * full rather than derived from the slug.

  /*
   * Places
   *
   * `khor-virap.png` is byte-for-byte the same file as `public/hero-ararat.png`,
   * the homepage hero — same 1355×793 image, same SHA-256, copied into the
   * registry's directory rather than referenced across. That is an editorial
   * decision, recorded here because §17 of PROJECT_STATE.md exists to stop
   * unrecorded claims about artwork: the hero is hereby declared Armat-generated
   * editorial artwork on the same terms as everything else in this map, which is
   * what lets it inherit `ARTWORK_PROVENANCE` below and be captioned
   * AI-generated. The provenance is now stated for both copies, not neither.
   *
   * Two consequences to keep in mind rather than rediscover. The same picture is
   * now the homepage hero *and* one article's cover, so it appears twice on a
   * reader's first visit; and it is a 1.4 MB PNG against a registry whose WebP
   * files run from 85 KB to 481 KB, so this slug's card and hero are the heaviest
   * images on the site by a wide margin. It is also the only entry here that is
   * not 1586×992. Neither file is altered, optimised or renamed here — replacing
   * this entry with a lighter, place-specific WebP is a later piece of work, and
   * it is a one-line change because every consumer already asks `getImageSrc`.
   *
   * `Hero.tsx` still points at `/hero-ararat.png` directly and is untouched.
   *
   * `etchmiadzin-cathedral.webp` is what that later piece of work looks like when
   * it is done properly, and it is the reason the paragraph above is worth
   * keeping: it is a 1586×992 WebP like every other file in this map, it depicts
   * the building its slug names, and it replaced a `PENDING_ARTWORK` entry rather
   * than an approximation. Registering it was a one-line change that reached the
   * article hero, the listing card and featured block, the search thumbnail, the
   * Open Graph and Twitter tags and the sitemap image at once.
   *
   * `erebuni-fortress.webp` did the same for the third place and is 1586×992 too,
   * so the "only entry not 1586×992" note above still refers to Khor Virap alone.
   * Two things about this file are worth knowing rather than rediscovering: at
   * 742 KB it is the heaviest WebP in the registry by a wide margin (the next is
   * 470 KB), and it is the only entry carrying an embedded ICC profile. Neither is
   * a fault and neither was touched — the file is registered exactly as delivered,
   * unaltered, unoptimised and unrenamed, which is the rule this map has followed
   * since §30.
   *
   * `matenadaran.webp` is the fourth place and arrived in the same shape as
   * Erebuni: 1586×992, lossy VP8, an embedded ICC profile, and 701 KB — so the two
   * heaviest files in the registry are now the two most recent, and "the only
   * entry carrying an ICC profile" above should read *the first*. Worth watching
   * if the places section keeps growing, but not a fault and not a reason to touch
   * either file: both are registered exactly as delivered.
   *
   * With this entry `PENDING_ARTWORK` is empty for the third time (§32, §34, §36).
   * The list emptying is the normal end state, not a signal that it can go.
